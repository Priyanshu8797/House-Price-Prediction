# House-Price-Prediction
Project Description
The goal of this project is to predict house prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and other relevant data. We will use the Linear Regression algorithm, which is ideal for regression problems.

Key Features of the Project
1.Dataset: We use a publicly available dataset such as the Boston Housing Dataset or Kaggle's house price datasets.
2.Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize numerical data.
3.Model Training: Implement and train a Linear Regression model.
4.Evaluation: Evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
5.Visualization: Provide plots to visualize predictions, feature importance, and residuals.
